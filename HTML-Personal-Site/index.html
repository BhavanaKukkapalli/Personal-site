    <p><em>Student at <a href ="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a></em></p>
    <p>I've always wanted to travel around the world and try foods from all across the globe. 
      Given the pervasiveness and accessibility of modern technology, it appeared to be child's play. 
      Then I recalled my first time messing around with the Java tutorials and 
      had the idea to write some code to make utilizing technology simpler for people at all ages and 
      skill levels. To my shock, I found that I really like coding, 
      as well as figuring out approaches to difficult problems and taking on future efforts.
    </p>
    <p>I've always been motivated to succeed professionally by the joy 
      I've felt from putting my skills to use and by witnessing the profound effects that coding can have on both technology and 
      the way people see the world. My expertise lies in the areas of problem-solving, design-principal application, and 
      Model View Controller (MVC) approaches to the structure of software applications. 
      What I've learned thus far is Java, Python, Ruby, C/C++, JavaScript, Hive, HTML and CSS. Still, 
      I enthusiastically learn and incorporate into the coding web in my head any new languages, frameworks, or principles that come my way.
